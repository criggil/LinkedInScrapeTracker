OpenAI claims it will be revolutionising the way we interact with technology with its upcoming AI agent, 'Operator.' This innovative tool is designed to work autonomously, taking over repetitive tasks and allowing us to focus on what truly matters. Could this be the next big leap in AI, transforming how we work and connect? How does it differ from its competition? OpenAI is not revealing anything new compared to its rivals, who've already announced their upcoming launches or even previews of their similar solutions. \u26a1 'Operator' is anticipated to launch as a research preview and developer tool by January 2025. This means we'll have to wait for quite some time for an open release, with a delayed EU launch for sure. \u26a1 The AI agent will automate routine tasks, enhance web browsing experiences, and optimise online interactions. 'Operator' can help with everyday tasks like booking meetings, ordering food, managing travel arrangements, or even handling routine customer queries\u2014aiming to simplify and enhance daily life. \u26a1 With players like Anthropic , Microsoft , and Google all entering the arena with similar offerings, the race to perfect autonomous AI agents is heating up, signalling a broader shift in how digital assistants will shape our future. \u26a1 Tools like 'Operator' could unlock new efficiencies, enabling professionals to prioritise strategic and creative endeavours while repetitive tasks are handled in the background.

    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 Just wrapped up two incredible days at the Public Sector Executive Summit: Generative AI and the Future City at Harvard University . It was inspiring to be surrounded by many visionary city and county leaders, all rethinking how to better serve their communities. Big thanks to David Graham and Dr. David S. Ricketts for organizing such an outstanding event and for inviting me to be part of it. I had the honor of speaking on a panel with Erik Caldwell and Jennifer Sanders about The Future of Engagement & Thriving Communities, where I shared two case studies on how the with Community Hub s platform is helping the City of Aurora, IL, and Jasper County, IA, build stronger, more connected communities. Seeing how excited people were about what we\u2019re doing was a big moment for me! Now for the fun stuff: During the Peer Learning Workout Session, brilliantly led by Stephanie Wade and Michael Baskin , my team ( Angie O'Brien , David Calder , Augustine Boateng , and me) crushed it in the Marshmallow Challenge. We built the tallest structure using only marshmallows and spaghetti sticks! A little creativity, teamwork, and friendly competition go a long way. \ud83d\udcaa The dinner at the Harvard Museum of Natural History was another standout moment. Shoutout to Joshua Baron, for making it extra fun by getting everyone to share their favorite karaoke songs, albums, and concerts. Oh, and yes, we survived the freezing Harvard University tour at 21\u00b0F (-6\u00b0C)! \u2744\ufe0f Key Takeaways: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 AI isn\u2019t the future! it\u2019s right now. We need to leverage it in every aspect of what we do. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Invest in learning and experimenting. If we want to get it right, we need to invest in learning and experimenting with AI across the board. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Cross-disciplinary collaboration and the build-measure-learn feedback loop are still the fastest way to solve real problems. Whether it\u2019s the Marshmallow Challenge or the Harvard case study on Chilean Mining, this method always gets results. At With, we\u2019re living these lessons every day, helping cities and counties connect with their communities better. This summit reminded me why I\u2019m so proud of the work we do and the incredible people I get to do it with.

    "content": "Had a great fireside chat at Stripe HQ yesterday with CTO David Singleton and CMO Jeff Titterton where we discussed how fast, affordable, and clean waterborne transportation could be a game changer for the greater Bay Area. It offers solutions to the key issues plaguing the Bay including the housing crisis, traffic congestion, and the post pandemic return to the office. For instance, the commute from Alameda to Oyster Point/South SF (which has about 200 companies) typically takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but it's less than 15 minutes on N30. A similar fast commute can be achieved to Redwood City. This not only saves massive amount of time for those already commuting these routes but suddenly enables companies in these tech hubs to tap into a larger talent pool located \u201cfar away\u201d from traditional commuting perspective. Employees can now choose to live in areas with more spacious and affordable family housing options, all within a reasonable commute. While I remain optimistic about eventual emergence of flying cars and other innovations, I believe it's crucial to address the existing challenges in the Bay Area with practical solutions we have available today, such as clean and efficient water taxis/ shuttles with low operational costs. As they say, build something that people needs. Not doing that is a disservice to this incredible city. Thanks for having me, Stripe ! (And we are a very happy user at Navier !) #twilightatOP",

I was born and diagnosed with a mild case of spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, a neurological condition that once made me believe \"athlete\" and \"Genna\" could never be used in the same sentence. A year ago, that all changed when I stepped into a CrossFit-style gym. During my first class, the instructor, now \u201cCoach\u201d, demoed box jumps, a movement where one must jump ridiculously high onto a box. Afterwards, I shamefully whispered to him, \u201cI can\u2019t jump \u2013 let alone that high.\u201d He proceeded to bring over a weighted plate and asked me to jump on it. I hesitated, scared to jump without holding on to something. Coach held out his hands, smiled, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d I began to jump. Each jump was a victory. I was doing it. While I haven\u2019t made it to a box yet, I\u2019m proud to say the height of the plates has gotten taller. #progress While I\u2019m working towards the goal of qualifying for my first competition, I am now faced with a new challenge: losing my job at Pitney Bowes due to a corporate restructure. I\u2019m sad to no longer be part of the PB family after nearly six years, but this loss has brought on an epiphany. It\u2019s time to align my passion for fitness, health, and wellness with my superpowers in social, digital, influencer marketing, and sales enablement, all while being a dedicated disability advocate. I\u2019m asking my network if you recommend any employers in this space or have connections, to please message me. Embracing this new path fills me with excitement and determination.

They can manage the entire state cycle, intelligently advise on state transitions, introduce new states when necessary, and handle exceptions or out-of-state situations. This process can be executed in tandem with an agent, allowing the LLM to focus on the more sophisticated tasks of state transition and management. Addressing LLM hallucinations can be accomplished by using a knowledge graph to validate the state transitions. This approach essentially positions LLMs as intelligent workflow engines.

    "content": "We have been playing around with LLMs and GPTs for sometime now experimenting with #RAG , chunking, On-premise and Managed models, and the various vector databases in the market as of today. Here is a quick insight on the potential LLM stack for building the #copilots / LLMs of tomorrow (This is purely a suggestion based on our experience, and the landscape can change over time) - UI for enabling multi-user, multi-modal, context-aware chat with the ability to configure settings as required - Chainlit ( https://lnkd.in/gAhEjK7k ) - A way to manage the documents available and enable ETL to vector stores - Apache Airflow ( https://lnkd.in/g6-JsbjK ) - Document extraction: To enable extraction of text from the documents and even do OCR as required - Fitz from PyMuPDF ( https://lnkd.in/grwNU7y9 ) - Self-Hosted LLM Model: To enable embeddings by converting to vectors, do NLP operations, handle context, etc. - Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1-GGUF ( https://lnkd.in/gvCZcYFY ) from Mistral AI - Vectorstore: To enable storing the embeddings, do similarity search and enable RAG - Milvus ( https://milvus.io/ ) - Orchestration Framework: LangChain ( https://lnkd.in/gGdAueGq ) - Persistence for application/user specific data like chat history, human feedback, etc. - PostgreSQL ( https://lnkd.in/gNGH786z ) - Language for LLMs: Python ( https://www.python.org/ ) While these are my suggestions, there is a very promising article by Andreessen Horowitz here: https://lnkd.in/g5xA6gwF which gives you a great idea about the LLM landscape and you can see the accompanying Github repo giving more details here: https://lnkd.in/g86QE4iE which is more updated. There are various newcomers to this market every day. For instance, I was experimenting with https://lnkd.in/gyDF2BRz yesterday but of course they come with their own challenges being \"newcomers\": https://lnkd.in/gVHQWhsN There is one thing I am very sure of though. #LLMs are going to be everywhere and it is going to make access to information and usability better for everyone within the next year. Wondering what the next trend would be? I predict that it will be on #cybersecurity and #governance considering LLMs are going to need a different kind of security and data governance than the way conventional security/governance systems are structured. Also, considering the vast amounts of data they are trained on, it's very important to have all of them secure and controlled. Looking to have your own copilots done?

    "content": "Today is a HUGE day for team Athina AI (YC W23) . We're finally launching something we've been working on for months - Athina IDE. We first launched Athina almost a year ago as an LLM Observability platform. Over the last 11 months, we've supported hundreds of teams, helping them monitor and evaluate millions of logs in production automatically. After months of feedback and learning, we recognized a critical need for better experimentation. Which brings us to today's launch... \ud83e\uddea Athina IDE is a collaborative editor for AI teams to prototype, experiment, and evaluate LLM-powered products \ud83c\udfaf Core Philosophies 1. Great AI products are a team effort: PMs, Data Scientists, SWEs, MLEs, QA teams, etc., all have to come together to build something great ...so we made sure that non-technical users can experiment, prototype, and run tests on Athina just as easily as technical users. 2. Great AI products are built around great data ... which is why the entire editor revolves around your data and gives you powerful controls like a spreadsheet. \ud83e\udd14 So what can AI teams do in this editor? 1. Work with Data Like a Spreadsheet: Filter, search, sort, edit, annotate, tag, and delete data with ease. 2. Prototype complex pipelines: Add dynamic columns to run LLM prompts, execute code, make API calls, retrieve data, run transformations and more. 3. Measure AI quality: Run evaluations within the editor itself - there are 50+ preset evaluation metrics or you can create your own custom evals (no-code). 4. Run Experiments: Re-generate datasets with different prompts, models, or retrieval parameters in just a few clicks. Technical users can run more complex experiments programmatically using our SDK. 5. Compare everything side-by-side: Athina IDE has a compare mode where you can compare any number of datasets side-by-side and run evaluations on all of them simultaneously. \u26a1\ufe0f How Early Users Are Using Athina IDE \u26a1\ufe0f 1. Testing Transcription Models: One of our early users is using Athina IDE to compare multiple speech-to-text models side-by-side using dynamic columns. 2. Creating Multi-Step Evaluations: Some teams have been creating multi-step evaluations that involve extracting structured data from LLM responses and then running JSON validation rules on it. 3. Comparing Multiple Models: Many teams are running experiments with 5-10 different models, or prompts, or retrievers + a suite of evals at once to determine the best fit for their specific use cases. We\u2019re super excited about this - if you're an AI product builder, we'd love to know what you think! See the link in the comments - our website has some demo videos. Huge shoutout to the team for all the effort that went into making this such a powerful product. Akhil Bisht Vivek Aditya Akshat Gupta Himanshu Bamoria",

    "content": "#UnderstandingAI , helpful article to grasp most of #AI on an intuitive level. I regularly read the ranting of Gary Marcus against the hype surrounding #LLMs , particularly #ChatGPT - with kind of questioning if he is right or just pissed, that he is not part of the big money game ... With his newest article, he totally got me. THE quote out of it, referencing \"thinking, fast and slow\" of #DanielKahnemann \" #neural #networks , which are good at kind of quick intuition from familiar examples (a la Kahneman\u2019s System I) ... #explicit #symbolic #systems that use formal logic and other reasoning tools (a la Kahneman\u2019s System II). \" https://lnkd.in/e9wWnnWn So my take is - probably different from his conclusion: #LLMs are #highly #useful for humanity, as we as humans can provide the checking of the results quite easily, AND we have to. It's a huge gain in efficiency, but not Artificial General Intelligence ( #AGI ). Use cases abundant. AGI will be solved once we get thinking slow fully aka proofing results from thinking fast with reasoning into systems, AND I assume, we will have to wait some time ; ) It's like driving a #Tesla , which has been selling its #autopilot feature for years, yet you still have to ensure you don't end up in a ditch.

It's about delivering value with measurable ROI, and understanding the risks upfront. That's the secret for successful AI transformation. \ud83d\udca1 \ud83d\ude80 So why haven't 85% of businesses fully embraced AI yet? It boils down to one thing: a lack of AI awareness or understanding of Cloud, data, and AI potential. \ud83d\udcc9 And why have 80% of businesses stumbled on the path to AI adoption? It's not for lack of trying, but rather poor AI strategy.

But there isn\u2019t any mechanism inherent in large language models (LLMs) that would seem to enable this and, if real, it would be completely unexplained. LLMs are not brains and do not meaningfully share any of the mechanisms that animals or people use to reason or think. LLMs are a mathematical model of language tokens. You give a LLM text, and it will give you a mathematically plausible response to that text. There is no reason to believe that it thinks or reasons\u2014indeed, every AI researcher and vendor to date has repeatedly emphasised that these models don\u2019t think. There are two possible explanations for this effect: 1/ The tech industry has accidentally invented the initial stages a completely new kind of mind, based on completely unknown principles, using completely unknown processes that have no parallel in the biological world. 2/ The intelligence illusion is in the mind of the user and not in the LLM itself.\u201d ******* PS: it\u2019s most likely based on 2 IMO\u2026 \u201cThe Psychic\u2019s Con\u201d Related\u2026 https://lnkd.in/efGbapED",

    "content": "Research-Trends: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhancing the Capabilities of Large Language Models Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to access and incorporate information from external knowledge bases. This external knowledge can be in the form of documents, articles, or databases. How does RAG work? Query Formulation: A user query is submitted to the RAG system. Document Retrieval: A specialized retrieval system, often powered by techniques like semantic search or vector databases, identifies relevant documents from the knowledge base. Contextual Understanding: The retrieved documents are processed and understood by the LLM. Response Generation: The LLM generates a response that is informed by both its internal knowledge and the external information retrieved from the knowledge base. Benefits of RAG: Improved Accuracy and Factuality: By grounding responses in external knowledge, RAG helps to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of generated text. Enhanced Relevance: RAG can provide more relevant and informative responses by tailoring them to the specific query and the available information. Adaptability to New Information: As new information is added to the knowledge base, RAG systems can adapt and provide up-to-date responses. Domain Expertise: RAG can be used to create domain-specific chatbots or virtual assistants by providing them with access to relevant domain knowledge. #Transformer #AI #ML #NLP #LLM #HybridModels",

Here's a mind-shifting perspective that changed how I think about AI implementation: The Problem: Most of us use AI like we're asking someone to write an essay without ever hitting backspace. One shot, no iterations, no refinement. Traditional Approach Falls Short: - Single-prompt interactions - Limited context - No self-correction capability - Zero-shot performance limitations The \"Aha\" Moment: Andrew Ng shared a fascinating insight: GPT-3.5 with an agentic workflow (allowing multiple iterations and self-reflection) outperformed GPT-4's single-shot performance on coding tasks. Numbers that matter: \u2022 GPT-3.5 (zero-shot): 48% accuracy \u2022 GPT-4 (zero-shot): 67% accuracy \u2022 GPT-3.5 with agentic workflow: >67% accuracy The New Approach: - Allow AI to plan its work - Enable self-reflection on initial outputs - Implement iterative improvements - Utilize multi-agent collaboration - Incorporate tool usage when needed Real-World Applications: - Software development - Content creation - Research analysis - Problem-solving - Strategic planning Key Learning: Success with AI isn't just about having the most powerful model \u2013 it's about creating intelligent workflows that mirror human thought processes. The Future Implications: This approach could democratize AI capabilities, allowing organizations to achieve premium-level results with more accessible models through better process design. #ArtificialIntelligence #Innovation #Technology #FutureOfWork #AI",

    "content": "Google : Agents - September 2024 This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent. Humans are fantastic at messy pattern recognition tasks. However, they often rely on tools - like books, Google Search, or a calculator - to supplement their prior knowledge before arriving at a conclusion. Just like humans, Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent, or a program that extends beyond the standalone capabilities of a Generative AI model.

    "content": "Sharing a great, thought-provoking post by Boris Levant on the shortcomings of the Turing Test as a metric for AI progress (the link is at the bottom of the post). In the comments, Boris makes this great distinction between the three sorts of behaviors we are trying to get models to emulate: 1. Acting Human 2. Thinking Human 3. Thinking/ Acting Rationally (with humans how we think and how we act are often very different, but for purely rational agents the only distinction is the realm of activity) Training models to do any one of these should be separate and mostly disjoint tasks. Yet, in the current state of AI, we expect or try to train a single model to do all of these. In reality, the one we should be prioritizing should be the third one, the goal of creating rational agents. The goal of technological development should be to overcome human weaknesses, and as has been repeatedly shown, as a species we struggle with rationality. If this is indeed the goal, the #RLHF is a terrible fine-tuning strategy. https://lnkd.in/dRtFpDaJ #ai #reinforcementlearning",

These trailblazing models are spearheading a new era of innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and showcasing the unparalleled capabilities of modern machine learning. Despite the rapid pace of innovation, it's crucial to remember the fundamental principles that established the field of machine learning. Traditional machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, k-means, and support vector machines, have stood the test of time and continue to underpin many real-world applications. It is also critical to have a good grasp of these traditional ML models because: \ud83d\udcda Foundational Knowledge: Traditional machine learning models provide the basis for understanding more complex AI concepts. They introduce essential ideas like supervised and unsupervised learning, overfitting, regularization, and optimization techniques. \ud83e\uddf1Building blocks for innovation: Traditional models are often combined or modified to create new, more powerful AI architectures. Familiarity with the basics enables you to contribute to innovation and tailor solutions for specific problems. \ud83d\udca1 Interpretability and intuition: Fundamental models provide transparency and intuition about how AI works. This understanding is vital for identifying biases, errors, and areas for improvement in more complex models. \u2b1b\u2753 Avoiding black box syndrome: Without a solid grasp of fundamentals, you might treat advanced AI models as black boxes, lacking insight into their inner workings. This can lead to misunderstandings and misapplications. \ud83d\ude80 Context for advancements: Knowing the limitations and challenges of traditional models helps appreciate the innovations and breakthroughs in Generative AI and LLMs. You'll better comprehend the problems they solve and their trade-offs. \ud83d\udd27 Efficient troubleshooting: Understanding traditional models allows you to learn more complex AI concepts and troubleshoot and debug issues more effectively. \u2696\ufe0f Appreciation for ethical considerations: Foundational knowledge allows you to better address ethical concerns in AI development and deployment, such as bias and explainability. During the month of May, I'll be sharing insights on the most popular traditional machine learning models, exploring their inner workings, practical use cases, applications to GenAI, limitations, assumptions, and the timeless wisdom they offer to aspiring data scientists and seasoned professionals alike. Join me on this journey as we uncover the beauty and elegance of machine learning, one model at a time. #MachineLearningMay #ML #TraditionalModels #DataScience #AI #DeepLearning #GenAI #LLMs",

    "content": "New short course: Build Long-Context AI Apps with Jamba. Learn about state space models (SSMs), which have emerged as an alternative to transformers. Specifically, Jamba is a hybrid transformer-Mamba architecture that combines strengths of the transformer with ideas from SSMs. This course is built with AI21 Labs and taught by Chen Wang and Chen Almagor . The transformer architecture is computationally expensive when handling very long input contexts. But there's an alternative called Mamba, a selective state space model that can process very long contexts with a much lower computational cost. However, researchers found that the pure Mamba architecture underperforms in understanding the context, and gives lower-quality responses. To overcome this, AI21 developed the Jamba model, which combines Mamba's computational efficiency with the transformer's attention mechanism to help with the output quality. In this course, you\u2019ll learn about how state space models, and Jamba, work. You\u2019ll also learn how to prompt Jamba, use it to process long documents, and build long-context RAG apps. - Learn how Jamba combines transformer and state space model architectures to achieve high performance and quality - Use the AI21 SDK, with an example of prompting over a large 200k-token annual financial report of Nvidia - Use Jamba for tool-calling, with hands-on examples from calling simple arithmetic calculations to a function that returns quarterly company financial reports. - Learn how training for long context is done, and the metrics used for its evaluation - Create a RAG app using the AI21 Conversational RAG tool and build your own RAG pipeline that uses Jamba and LangChain. By the end of this course, you'll learn how to build applications that can handle context as long as an entire book. Please sign up here: https://lnkd.in/gvvjJ5tg",

    "content": "BERT: A Powerful Tool for Natural Language Processing One of the challenges of traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods is their inability to understand contexts in texts. This owes largely to the fact that these methods analyze texts sequentially, missing key connection between words and their surrounding elements. This is where BERT comes in. BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a type of Large Language Model (LLM) that has changed how we approach the field of NLP. Unlike previous models of its kind, BERT is trained on unlabeled text data in a bidirectional manner, allowing it to understand the context of words within a sentence. This capability makes BERT highly effective in various NLP applications like text encoding, question answering and response generation. Text Encoding BERT can transform text into a numerical representation that captures its meaning. This allows other machines to easily process and analyze the text. Search engines can leverage this for tasks like summarizing documents or ranking search results based on relevance. Question Answering BERT is excellent at finding answers to your questions within a given text corpus. Imagine posing a question about a specific topic on a webpage \u2013 BERT can analyze the text and pinpoint the relevant answer section. Response Generation BERT can craft human-quality responses to prompts and emails. This can be incredibly useful for chatbots or virtual assistants, enabling them to have more natural and engaging conversations. Search Engine Example Let's take a search engine using BERT. When you enter a query, BERT can analyze the surrounding words and context to understand your intent. It can then look for webpages that not only contain the keywords but also discuss them in a relevant way. This leads to more accurate and user-friendly search results.

AI agents are the next big thing\u2014you already know that. \ud83d\ude04 But building enterprise-grade AI agents is no walk in the park. It involves tackling multiple challenges: - Managing agent memory with RBAC/ security - Orchestrating agent behavior - Making the agent accessible via a UI, API, or other channels - Implementing human-in-the-loop to verify outputs - Monitoring agent performance That\u2019s a lot of work! So, we built DeepModel, an end-to-end, fully managed agent builder platform. It comes packed with everything you need\u2014RAG, agent orchestration, UX, tooling, human-in-the-loop, and monitoring\u2014all in one ready-to-go platform. And here\u2019s the kicker: Building an AI agent typically means starting in a Jupyter Notebook and writing Python code. But with DeepModel, you can build your agent by simply providing instructions in plain English! Want to extend it further with your own code? We are going to support that, too. Our goal is simple: help you ship AI agents faster than it takes to set up dependencies in your Jupyter Notebook. \ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f Below is a 101-second fly-over video of the builder platform. \u2705 Check out our website ( www.deepmodel.ai ) for more videos and sign up to get access (there\u2019s a waitlist, but the sooner you join, the sooner you\u2019ll be building). \ud83e\udd17 Wait, there\u2019s more!

One of the best approaches was suggested by Andrej Karpathy - the \"LLM OS.\" Andrej suggests that LLMs can coordinate and manage resources similarly to an operating system, allowing for more sophisticated interactions without user intervention. This positions LLMs not just as tools, but as integral components of a broader computational framework. The LLMs can exhibit \"agentic\" behavior, enabling them to take initiative and make decisions based on user input. While we are still far from fully autonomous agents, in my opinon you can still create a scaled-down version for specific tasks by following these steps: - Define Clear Objectives - Break Down Tasks - Select Appropriate Tools - Implement Decision-Making Logic through prompts - Enable Adaptability for ambiguous inputs - Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms - Test and Iterate Let me know what you think.

The graph below is a clear testament to this exponential growth, highlighting the leaps AI has made in reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. Take a look at the latest performance benchmarks\u2014models like OpenAI o1 preview and Gemini Advanced are not only reaching human-level intelligence but are beginning to exceed it. The trajectory is undeniable: these models are becoming faster, smarter, and more versatile with each iteration. Here are a few key trends driving this shift: \u2022 AI is mastering multi-modal intelligence: Models like GPT-4 Omni (Vision) and Gemini Advanced (Vision) are breaking barriers by integrating language understanding with advanced vision capabilities, challenging the human brain\u2019s ability to process diverse information. \u2022 Surpassing human-level reasoning: AI models are no longer just following predefined logic; they\u2019re demonstrating reasoning abilities that often outperform humans in certain tasks. \u2022 Exponential learning curves: The speed at which AI models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet and Llama-3.1 are evolving is staggering. With continuous learning, their ability to solve complex problems is outpacing human adaptability. At this rate, AI won\u2019t just be an assistant to human intelligence; it may soon outshine our natural cognitive abilities in key areas like decision-making, data analysis, and creative problem solving.

Here\u2019s 5 insights Google just shared about AI Agents you should know. \ud83e\udd16 \ud83d\ude4b\u2642\ufe0fIf your AI provider isn\u2019t talking about frameworks like Reasoning and Acting ( #ReAct ), Chain-of-Thought ( #CoT ), or Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), it\u2019s time to ask a critical question: Do they truly have their own Agentic IP? \ud83e\udd14 \ud83c\udd94At IDPrivacy AI , we\u2019re not just building models\u2014we\u2019re building agents with real cognitive capabilities. \ud83e\udde0 Agents are smarter, more adaptive, and the future of AI. Don\u2019t just take our word for it; here are 5 key insights from Google about AI agents that validate why we\u2019re ahead: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Agents are smarter than regular models: They don\u2019t just process\u2014they reason, act, and adapt. This is why we built Agentic AI frameworks that go beyond static models. \u201cKnowledge [in traditional models] is limited to what is available in their training data,\u201d the paper notes. \u201cAgents extend this knowledge through the connection with external systems via tools.\u201d - more \ud83d\udc47 below 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Cognitive architecture is key: Smarter agents require an underlying structure. Our architecture integrates reasoning frameworks like ReAct, CoT, and ToT to enable decision-making in real-time, and multi-tool integrations. More below \ud83d\udc47 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Tools expand agent reach: Agents become exponentially more powerful with access to knowledge bases, APIs, and data set tools. That\u2019s why we built multi-tool integration to create agents with expansive, actionable intelligence. But they work even better with Advanced RAG and TAG more below \ud83d\udc47 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Agentic RAG makes agents better: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) connects agents to real-time knowledge, making them more precise and versatile. We developed our own Agentic RAG solution to meet these needs. We also built our own natural language 2 sql bringing AI to the quantitative level. \ud83d\udc47 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Quantitative AI is the future: Few are talking about TXT2SQL and how it\u2019s redefining quantitative AI to make agents capable of structured data manipulation. We\u2019re leading the charge, building agents that turn raw data into actionable insights and predictive outcomes for real business application. \ud83d\udc4dAt ID Privacy AI, we aren\u2019t just building frameworks\u2014we\u2019re delivering AI that\u2019s private, scalable & tailored to enterprise needs. \ud83d\ude80 From private AI infrastructure to RAG-driven AI agents, our solutions redefine how businesses think about AI So, is your vendor truly Agentic, or are they just offering glorified models? \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f #AI #AgenticAI #ReAct #ChainOfThought #TreeOfThoughts #Innovation #PrivacyFirstAI #TXT2SQL #RAG #IDPrivacyAI Share: Muaz Maqbool Jared Biggs George W.

AI is maturing. We're transitioning from quick, pattern-based responses\u2014referred to as System 1 thinking\u2014to a more deliberate and thoughtful approach known as System 2 reasoning. Imagine an AI that not only reacts but also takes a moment to analyze, reason, and solve problems creatively. This isn't merely an upgrade; it's a fundamentally new understanding of what AI can achieve. At SimpleWorks , this concept resonates deeply with our mission. Our R-YaBot, powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), already provides fast, accurate answers based on enterprise data. However, we're not stopping there.

    "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have undeniably revolutionized the AI landscape. They've shown impressive capabilities in generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. As the technology has maturing and becoming more accessible, the focus is shifting from the model itself to its practical applications. The LLMs have become more powerful, they've also become more commoditized. Many models, developed by different companies, often showcase similar capabilities. This raises the question: If the core technology is becoming increasingly similar, how can businesses differentiate themselves? The answer is - Innovative Applications. The real value of LLMs lies not in the model itself, but in how it's applied. Businesses that can effectively leverage LLMs to solve real-world problems and create unique user experiences will gain a competitive edge. By focusing on innovative applications, businesses can harness the full potential of LLMs and differentiate themselves in the market. The future of AI lies not just in the development of powerful models, but in their effective deployment to solve real-world problems. You don't have to come up with a completely new idea for AI usage however you can enhance existing applications by leveraging AI capabilities. Here is an example of Google Meet, how it's using GenAI capabilities to take meeting notes, summarize them. I would not be surprised if based on meeting content, it can create followup meeting invites, add tasks, set reminders and much more. Let's identify simple problems in existing applications and see how GenAI can solve them. #LLMs #genai #applications #generativeai #ai #artificialintelligence",

    "content": "Large Language Models with External Knowledge Imagine \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udde0! You have a super-smart assistant who tackles any task. But, sometimes their knowledge might be limited. And, here Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps bridge this gap by allowing large language models (LLMs) to access and leverage information from external sources before generating text. Let's see how it works: 1) User Input \u21b3 You provide a prompt for the LLM 2) Retrieval \u21b3 The LLM uses this prompt to search for relevant information in the knowledge base (VectorDB). 3) Augmentation \u21b3 The LLM combines the retrieved information with its internal knowledge. 4) Generation \u21b3 Finally, the LLM uses this combined knowledge to generate a more accurate and informative response. It allows these powerful models to go beyond simple text generation but accurate text generation. #AI #MachineLearning #LLMs #RAG #Innovation #Learning",

    "content": "RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation)- I know you have seen this acronym many times on the internet, I think it's very important to distill what RAG means and why we talk about RAG in LLM(Large Language Model). Do you know datacentric AI sometimes hallucinates? Yes, they do when its dealing with much complex prompts from users. Again what does it look like when you say AI hallucinates? AI, especially LLM models like #GPT , #mistra and other large language model systems were trained with large amounts of data from the internet, their responses indexed so many responses for a simple but complex question/prompt. In this case, you may see more than 5 responses for just one prompt because the LLM wasn't sure of the best answer, this is a disadvantage to critical cases like hospital patient chatbots. So let's quickly dive into RAG, RAG allows ML engineers to build LLM AI with their content, it's not a model, it's just an architecture, and its a very simple architecture- you can simply call it your knowledge base LLM. RAG helps you define how your LLM AI responds to users in a well-defined and specific way. This in turn helps with LLM accuracy. How does RAG work? For any institution, you need to prepare your data(it could be a repository of research, conversations, reports, product reviews, ticket responses from customer support, engineering solution documentation, tutorial documents etc). \u270d Your data will be chunked(I wrote about chunks and token in my last post) into sentences, paragraphs, words- this is very easy this days, you can easily read up on many different ways LangChain or Hugging Face . Chunking data makes it easier for your LLM to be well-trained and retrieve specific information in response to prompts. \u270d Your chunks will be embedded into a vector(a simple mathematics vector of numbers)- this could be confusing for non-data experts or people with math-phobia but do not worry about this just understand the concept. \u270d Lastly you introduce any LLM prompt engineering model to define how your response is fed to users with new questions. This is the simplest process of RAG, it could be more complex in cases where you need to fine-tune your model. As users of AI or LLM products out there, you may need to try it out and see how AI hallucinates by just providing a prompt that's probably not easy to find on the internet- you will get the gist better. AI could be better with #RAG ...

    "content": "In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) shapes the fabric of our daily lives and occupies my mind incessantly as a #FemaleFounderinAI , Dr. Fei-Fei Li's memoir, \"The Worlds I See,\" emerges not just as a narrative of technological innovation but as a beacon of human resilience, diversity, and ethical responsibility. As a female scientist in the predominantly male-dominated field of AI, Dr. Li's journey is nothing short of #inspirational . Her memoir intricately weaves the tale of her #immigration from China to the United States, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of navigating a new country and culture. This aspect of her story resonates deeply with me, as it is showcasing the strength and determination required to pursue one's dreams against all odds. Dr. Li's contributions to AI, most notably the creation of #ImageNet , have been pivotal in ushering in the current era of deep learning. However, \"The Worlds I See\" delves beyond her scientific achievements, offering a deeply personal look into the life of a woman who dared to dream big. Her story is a testament to the power of #curiosity , #exploration , and #discovery , driving home the point that #innovation is not just about #technology but about the people behind it. \"The Worlds I See\" is more than a memoir; it's a blueprint for future generations of scientists and founders, especially women and immigrants, illustrating that with #passion and #perseverance , barriers can be broken, and new frontiers can be explored. Dr. Li's story is a powerful reminder that in the quest to unlock the mysteries of AI, our greatest resource is our shared humanity. I'd like to share this quote as it highly resonates with me: \u201cIn the real world, there\u2019s one North Star \u2014 Polaris, the brightest in the Ursa Minor constellation. But in the mind, such navigational guides are limitless. Each new pursuit,\u2014each new obsession \u2014 hangs in the dark over its horizon, another gleaming trace of iridescence, beckoning. That\u2019s why my greatest joy comes from knowing that this journey will never be complete. Neither will I. There will always be something new to chase. To a scientist, the imagination is a sky full of North Stars.\" I\u2019m glad I read this book when I truly decided to start my #founder journey. I think the book spoke to me a lot as a #FemaleFounder as much as it spoke to my fellow #FemaleScientists ! Fei-Fei Li Thanks for being the inspiration for all of us, #FemaleScientists as well as #FemaleFounders ! I wish having many more #NorthStars in the future! #AI #WomenInSTEM #DiversityInTech #innovation #dreamBig #determination #grit #persistence #HumanCenteredAI #TheWorldsISee #FeiFeiLi",
