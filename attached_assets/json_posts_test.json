      "post_text": "Even from the comfort of Sweden, it was exciting and rewarding to follow and support our communication at Climate Week New York. Listen in below to hear our CEO, Jesper Brodin , speak with the New York Times and Patagonia on how the consumer industry can decarbonize value chains and enhance product circularity. It's good business to be a good business! Beyond knowledge sharing, Climate Week is also a key time for delivering key policy asks to the public sector. By advocating for systemic change, brands like IKEA can make it easier for all in society to join the energy transformation - widening the scope of our positive impact. To enable the transformation across society, Ingka Group welcomes the following actions from governments: ‚úîÔ∏è Increase greenhouse gas reduction targets in line with the 1.5¬∞C target to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. ‚úîÔ∏è Set short and long-term policies within their NDCs in line with the 1.5¬∞C target to finance and accelerate the transition to renewable energy, circular economy, as well as sustainable transport, food systems, reducing food waste, agriculture, and forestry. ‚úîÔ∏è Accelerate the renewable energy transition and phase out fossil fuels that still account for most of the energy demand. Invest in necessary infrastructure and streamline permitting processes to enable businesses and people to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions faster. https://lnkd.in/dfB3Mpk6 #ClimateWeekNYC #CommittoClimate",

        "post_text": "A Positive Shift Our world is facing unprecedented challenges, from climate change to social inequality. To address these issues, we need a fundamental shift in our mindset. A positive work attitude can ripple out into our personal lives and communities. When we find fulfillment in our work, we are more likely to make choices that benefit society and the environment. Digital technologies have provided us with powerful tools to connect, collaborate, and create positive change. Consider Patagonia, a company that donates a significant portion of its profits to environmental causes. By integrating environmental stewardship into their business model, they have inspired countless others to follow suit. It's time for organizations to prioritize purpose over profit. By fostering a culture of positivity and sustainability, we can create a better future for ourselves and generations to come. Let's embrace technology, reduce our greed, and increase our love for one another.",

        "post_text": "Excited to celebrate #WorldEnvironmentDay today! üåç As a farmer‚Äôs daughter, I‚Äôve had the privilege of learning directly from Mother Nature. Each cycle of planting and harvesting has shown me the importance of balance, resilience, and sustainable practices. These aren‚Äôt just lessons for farming‚Äîthey‚Äôre lessons for life. üü£As we reflect on our relationship with the environment, let‚Äôs consider sustainability at every level. It‚Äôs about individual actions and corporate responsibility alike. Whether it‚Äôs reducing waste, recycling, or supporting eco-friendly initiatives, we all have a role to play. üü£For business owners, this means integrating sustainability into our business models and operations. It‚Äôs not just good ethics; it‚Äôs good business. As individuals, small actions like planting trees, starting a garden, or even choosing local produce can make a big difference. üü£Let‚Äôs use today to commit to protecting our planet with joy and enthusiasm. After all, every effort counts in creating a sustainable future for all. üü£So let‚Äôs have some fun while we‚Äôre at it‚Äîengage in nature, make sustainable choices, and inspire others to do the same. Together, we can make a real impact! üå±‚ú®",

This is more than just a professional milestone for me - I‚Äôve always been passionate about creating products that help people connect and build meaningful relationships, and I can‚Äôt think of a better place to carry on this work than at Bumble. I believe that technology can help us solve human problems in many untapped ways. I actually met my wife Sara online, so I have a profound appreciation for how tech products can facilitate online introductions that end up changing the course of our lives in incredibly meaningful ways - so Bumble‚Äôs goal to redefine online to real world connections to help people find real, authentic relationships couldn‚Äôt be more exciting to me. The company‚Äôs mission and determination to lead with its values of kindness, respect and equality to drive healthy relationships resonates with me deeply, and I‚Äôm excited to help shape the future of Bumble‚Äôs product experience alongside such a talented team. Over the last two decades working in both consumer and enterprise organizations, I‚Äôve learned the power of customer-centric innovation, experimentation, and exceptional design. Most recently at Salesforce, I had the privilege of working with some of the world‚Äôs leading brands to create transformative e-commerce solutions. Now, I‚Äôm looking forward to bringing those insights to Bumble as we continue building products that truly make a difference. I‚Äôm energized by the vision and pace of innovation set by Lidiane Jones , so here‚Äôs to an exciting new chapter - I can‚Äôt wait to get started! üíõ",

Here's why: We took over an account that was optimizing heavily for view through conversions and returning customers on Meta (unconsciously, we hope). The team at adpros started optimizing for new customers and we cut new customer CPA targets from $300 to $150 to $100. We also completely transformed the creative strategy that's led to new winners beating the old $300 new customer CPA (NCCPA) in Tripelwhale to as low as $50 in the testing phase. It's your responsibility as a media buyer to keep decreasing CPA targets to be honest and push limits of what's possible to break records. =================================== Follow Nehal Kazim to learn how to add a million a month in revenue profitably!",

        "post_text": "I‚Äôve seen the concerns from the UEFN community about this month‚Äôs engagement payouts and how Epic‚Äôs new algorithm favors islands that attract outside audiences. I understand why people are upset, and I too want to share my perspective. We all want this ecosystem to grow in a fair and sustainable way. But business decisions don‚Äôt always feel fair, especially in a fast-changing space like this. When I started, I was balancing a regular job while creating content as a hobby. It wasn‚Äôt until I secured brand partnerships that I could fully commit to growing Alliance in this risky space. It wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîit required strategic planning, long hours, and a constant willingness to adapt. For those who might not know, MackJack and Alliance haven‚Äôt always had the same discovery success as some of our competitors. Even though this month was one of our best for engagement, I still worry about the stability of the engagement model, which is why we‚Äôve built our business to not rely solely on engagement payouts. While I believe the recent payout changes are important for the future, I also think they may have come too soon and in the wrong order. Before making these changes, we should have been given better tools to promote and market our own games effectively. Right now, we‚Äôre stuck promoting a phone number that leads to a full Fortnite download, only for our players to face other games before even reaching ours. This isn‚Äôt helping our games succeed. What we really need are more ways to create achievements, rewards, and meaningful experiences for our players, so we can genuinely build and engage our communities. I encourage everyone to continue sharing feedback with Epic to help improve the ecosystem. But I also encourage my fellow creators to take responsibility by adapting and building the foundations needed for a sustainable career path. #UEFN",
